 - Hello. I'm Matt.
 - I am just starting my coding journey after 40.
 - The only think I know about GitHub is this is where I go to get some 3rd party programs for Eve Online.
 - I also understand that I can store my awful new-guy projects here.
 - I look forward to many of you 'ACKSHUALLY'-ing everything I post for general neckbeard reasons.
